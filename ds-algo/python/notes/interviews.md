# Tidbits for Interviews


## Tips
* The more reasons you can provide for your design choices, the smarter you seem.



## Recommendations from Other Lessons


### Lesson 3: Searching and Sorting
1. Just memorize the efficiency of basic algorithms for interviews. They'll be impressed if you can just spit it out from the start.
2. The worst thing you can do is say "I've never seen this algorithm before."
    - If you really don't know what the answer is, make a result table and REALLY try to solve it.
3. Understand how sorting algorithms work and have their runtimes memorized to answer complexity problems really fast!
    - Remember that there is always a trade-off between less space vs. less time when implementing a sorting algorithm.
    - You can pick one way or the other, but say why you're doing so.


### Lesson 4: Maps and Hashing
1. You'll often be asked to create a hash table to show that you understand hashing as well as the upsides and downsides of designing one.
