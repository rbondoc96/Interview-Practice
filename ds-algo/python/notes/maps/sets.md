# Sets

A Set is another ADT/concept. It's comparable to a List, except that:
1. It has no order to its elements
2. It does not allow for repeated elements

A Set can be thought of as a bag; you can put your hand in, but you never know what order the elements will come out in.


In relation to Maps, a Map is a Set-based data structure in that a group of its keys form a Set.
- These keys do not form any order
- The keys may only appear once
    - Analogous to a finding a word's definition in a dictionary, multiple definitions would be shown as a list under the same word.
    - There would not be a second key for a second definition
