# Introduction to Maps

The defining characteristic of a map is its **key:value** structure.
- We can look up where something is using its key and then get whatever is stored as a value.

It's similar to an actual map in real life; we can look up something by its name and then go to its location to get the value.

Maps are also known as **dictionaries**. 
- The word can be considered the "key"
- The definition would then be the "value"


Maps can be used for things that have unique names. For example, we could have a course with an ID of "CS107" and it would stand for "Intro to Programming with Java".
- The course ID would be the key, and looking up information by the ID would show information about the course.
