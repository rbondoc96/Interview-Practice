# Lists

A List has all properties of a Collection. It has a group of things, but **the objects have an order**
- The elements might not be the same type of object, but they're still related to everything else in the list.
- The order doesn't mean much, just the order the items were placed.
- No fixed length
- One could keep adding things to end, removing from the middle, etc. and it doesn't really affect anything. How exactly these functions are implemented varies.

The implementation of a List varies across languages.
