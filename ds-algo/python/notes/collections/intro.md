# Collections

Collections are...a collection of stuff! But, we can make a few observations.
- They don't have a particular order. We could shuffle the elements and it wouldn't make a differencce.
- We can't say, 'give me the 3rd element in this collection' due to the lack of order.
- They don't need to have the SAME type of object.

Collections aren't used directly used in languages, but many data structures are extensions of collections.
