# Graphs

A Graph is a data structure designed to show relationships between objects. 
    For example, we might have a ton of data about websites, and we want to be able to search through them by which pages have links to each other. 

The purpose of a Graph is to show how different things are connected to one another. It is sometimes called a **network**. 

A Tree is actually a more specific type of Graph.
